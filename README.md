### Description
In this assignment I used HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather by using the weather data and images that are provided for this Challenge.

### Website Requirements
The website must consist of seven pages in total
* A [landing page]: that contains an explanation of the project
* Four [visualization pages]: latitude vs: max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, or wind speed).
* A ["Comparisons" page]: Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so they can easily be compared with each other.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations
